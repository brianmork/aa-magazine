This webpage is a project based assignment as part of our frontend development educational plan and the product is not actually a real magazine. We've been using the scrum method in order to plan, execute and retrospect on our progress and it's been really effective and helpful in planning the project from start to end. We've used GitHub projects for kanban and defining of MSCW.
